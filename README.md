#What is this?

BukkitPE is software for hosting Minecraft : Pocket Edition servers. From controlling everything you can possibly do on MCPE to everything players can ever imagine on a server, BukkitPE also has an API which lets developer extend it. Let's face it plain MCPE Server isn't fun :P That's mainly why we have an API. BukkitPE has Clean feels and Stable Features / Performance optimization.
